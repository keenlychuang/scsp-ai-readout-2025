# Military Notes

Joint Chief of Staff 

- Only about 7 weeks into the job. Shoutout to Sam Neil. The “Wisest man in Washington”, a major advisor in previous administrations.
    - The speaker had previously been in the audience. Insane attendance here.
- Previously fighter pilot, special forces, military, lots of life experiences. “Dual fluency family”
- We cannot do this alone. We need your help. Find and fuel the right technologies to the point where it becomes a strategic differentiator.
- Unprecedented times. Lots of risk globally, but that comes with opportunities.
    - We cannot continue to think country by country. We look globally.
    - Axis of align powers who do not align with our own. He claims our adversaries are working well together, sharing intelligence.
    - Barrier to new tech is low, but barrier to government business is high. This needs to change.
- “Joint Force” of the future, will be at the forefront.
- If required, hopefully not, deliver “overwhelming force” against our adversary.
- 3 things for that:
    - Must be properly armed at the point where people are planning, not when crisis is happening.
        - Wants to stay ahead on tech acquisition. Government needs to be a better buyer.
        - Reform, unified. “If not now, when? If not us, who?” People on both sides of the political spectrum and private too.
        - We need the courage to see it through.
    - Must be globally integrated.
        - Tech in the Pentagon. Typewriter in secret rooms because of access controls.
        - SNS: how can we possibly be even more integrated?
    - We need to be ready. Trained now, not later. Build redundancies and resilient tech.
        - Patriotic, diabolical minds. Entrepreneurs and leaders that create overwhelming strength.

National Security Advisor : Hank Schrader energy. 

- Ukraine Drone Attack: another step to show that Putin cannot sustain the war. More and more steps to convince him. Sanctions should go up in enforcement. More time for economic sanctions. Claims on slave labor from Africa working in Russian factories.
    - All of us have become like Israel. Society has to get used to defending ourselves from third dimensional threats. Golden dome, something like iron dome.
    - But we’re still not putting people out.
- Drone tech: the US needs to start manufacturing at scale. We are slower than the Ukrainians, who have a life or death motivator, but we need that urgency too.
- Iran Nuclear Deal: an Iran that is enriching, especially when we don’t have verification and inspection, “We can’t trust the Iranians”, who are restarting a program they claim never existed.
- Most imminent threat: Iran vs Israel
    - 95% estimated chance that one will strike the other.
- Cyber: NSA head fired, DHS restructure. CISA is an important bridge into the private sector.
    - We still have tremendous cyber professionals.
    - He is resistant against the idea that “we need all our best minds in the private sector”. The government is grateful for civil servants.
    - The current actions have not left us more vulnerable. But if the trends continue, idk.
    - We need some good offensive cyber. We need a “human capitol strategy” that brings people into government.
- US Capitol in China
    - For decades, we invested immensely in Chinese companies in 2014. PLA cyber and AI companies were invested in by US companies. xinzhang (cultural genocide)
    - Hippocratic oath: don’t invest in PLA, don’t help them perfect police state, don’t compromise long term viability for short term profit.
    - Congress should take action. He envisions that the Trump administration will really work on tariffs, investment controls.
- Restoration of trust from the tensions.
    - “If we shoot our allies to get to China, China wins”
    - EU has also recognized China’s plan.
- “We could get tired of winning pretty soon” “We have capacity for progress from struggle, short of revolution”
    - Views autocrats, axis of opponents, are really fragile.
- Should we be worried about the tech sharing from our opponents? yes
- Mark Walz and Mark Rubio. Should one individual be in both jobs? no
    - split attention
    - half the staff might be able to do the job.
- USAID
    - shouldn’t just slash and burn
    - it was one of the best ways to combat CCP
- DOD: Not compromised
    - Biden: validation of victimhood. critical race theory. “there was some crazy stuff going on” “it was not equality of opportunity.” “Radical agenda”
    - Civillian appointees were pushing changes in the military. It should be the military pushing military. Military shouldn’t be in politics.
- “We can agree with 80% of what we do”
