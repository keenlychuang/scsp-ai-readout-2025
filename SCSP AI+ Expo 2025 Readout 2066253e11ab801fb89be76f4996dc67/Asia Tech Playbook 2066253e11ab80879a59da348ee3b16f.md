# Asia Tech Playbook

Yoon Kim, Chih Wu, Mika Takagi, Chandrasekar Venkatraman, Jane Kim 

Key features for Asia Tech Success: 

- (Taiwan) Education System: is able to attract top tier students, especially in the engineering divisions. High school students are attracted to the prospect doing engineering.
    - The Taiwanese government is able to bridge the industry research with the universtiy/academic research.
    - Semiconductors: Taiwan was able to build the infrastructure around the FABs to invite labs, not just building the labs themselves or attracting the talent.
- (South Korea) Tech Talent Resource: government founded institutions like the one that Yoon Kim is from (HIIST).
    - Consumer interest in high tech: Consumers willing to buy, invest in cutting edge.
- (Japan) Evolutions, adoption of changes
    - Post War Economic Miracle! After the war, Japan was forced to innovate their own tech. The government has a 5 year innovation and tech plan that renews every 5 years.
    - Currently, focused on ecosystems. Increased VC funding by 5 fold in 10 years.
    - Manufacturing base; large porition, especially critical supply chain, is still domestic despite pushing some plants abroad.
- (Hitachi) Trying to bring a reliable AI experience into the industry experience.

Collaboration Between Countries 

- Foundry Model: Taiwan collaborates with designers, materials supply, etc. They don’t make their own product. By default, the model is collaborative.
    - TSMC is the best semiconductor company in the world.
    - Next step: AI foundry model. (ETree). A host of specific use cases/fields/disciplines to provide data and prospective. Also inherently collaborative, as they provide data and invite VC.
- (Hitachi) AI is multidisciplinary. AI COE; every country is bringing their own expertise. Ex; japan is about manufacturing, no option for failure. India is about scale, US is about agility and taking chances. An international repository for best practices.
- (Japan) Historically, Japanese companies do their own thing. Japan’s Industry is investing in startups. Wide range of small and large startups.
    - Corporate vs Pension funding for VC.
- (Korea) Twelve Labs is vision understanding. Originally needed captial from US SF, inclubated in seoul and started in SF. Twelve Labs is the Apple of vision foundation models.
    - The speaker for this company is truly a businessman. He really stole the question to talk about his own company.

US Asia Collaboration in the Future

- (Korea) Robotics: for consumer, defense.
- (Hitachi) Bringing manufacturing back with AI, where countries have an opportunity to leapfrog to the pace of the US. AI competence built into EVERY ASPECT.
- (Taiwan) Asian countries could provide the manufacturing expertise, where the US is able to provide the other innovation.
    - (Japan) echoing the points of the previous two. They have the manufacturing base, expertise, infrastructure, incentives, and consumers.
