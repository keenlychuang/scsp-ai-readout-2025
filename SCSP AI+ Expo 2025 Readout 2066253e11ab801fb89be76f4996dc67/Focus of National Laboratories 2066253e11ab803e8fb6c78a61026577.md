# Focus of National Laboratories

Main example: protein modeling, biological research breakthroughs with foundation models 

Ai driven manufacturing loops → energy, national security loops 

Sandia: predictive modeling

- internal operations are also integrating AI

How is it going to the public? 

- Los Alamos weapons labs
- Nuclear deterrence is the foundation of national security. Haven’t been tested since 1992
- Ai is bridging the gap between nuclear test data and nuclear weapons data.

Los Alamos

- the first age: manhattan project
- Second age: Cold War, backbone of natsec
- Third age: we thought democracy, capitalism prevailed.
- Fourth age: 10 years ago, Russia and China are pushing the envelope, investing and actively using military.
    - We hope we don’t end up in conflict, AI is analogous to the nuclear capabilities of the past
    - Investment in nuclear was good for our economic well being. Example: GPS.
        - Similarly, work in AI will have unexpected benefits in the broader economy.

- how to build trust in high stakes environments, both in people and results
    - 30 years worth of tools and prowess for nuclear
    - The best way to learn is to participate.
    - AI is not new. We’ve been doing this for decades.
    - National labs are looking at the public interest perspectives

- how to scale and maintain public interest? Intellectual property and private labs?
    - Collaboration is critical. Partnerships with frontier AI is key.
    - Intellectual property is not necessarily at the forefront, more of a mention than an actual property.
    - Economic and national security impacts. There are talks of “Manhattan Projext for AI”

More on partnerships 

- ethical considerations have been part of some of the private sector’s concerns their inceptions.
- Los alamos has faith!
- He’s also very bullish on putting more funding into some of the “smartest people in the country”
- However; the federal government can’t invest as much as private in the US
- Anthropic, Google, OpenAI make the investment for us. We don’t have to compete with them, they’re already fronting the bill. We don’t need to replicate what they’re doing.
- US is sitting in SF where it exists.
- USG is not trying to compete, but to have a hand. You’re going to be a communicator and a decision maker, communicating your needs but not driving the research. Not replacing AI companies

Greatest takeaway from the speakers/plug

- Thomas: nvidia’s HPCC: we are not operating at the scale we need to be. Only 10 of the staff could “Fully utilize” the 160 million dollar resource
- Kim: Important for people to appreciate how the national labs will benefit everyday lives. Most won’t be anticipated. The investment should feel worthwhile. Leadership matters, the US is still the leader and everyone will be watching.
- Green: nuclear monitoring, tritium research. Savannah river : bacon, the secret ingredient for mitigation
- Thornberry: the national labs are keeping people safe and free. Big challenge: using AI to do nuclear testing without actual nuclear testing.
