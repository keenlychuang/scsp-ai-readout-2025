# Keynote: Future of National Security

How to deploy predictive models in Nat Sec infrastructure 

- Private-Public partnerships, not public-private

Christopher Miller: “We need Ender’s Game baby” 

- We need kids planning thousands of iterations in an afternoon
- Fog, friction, fear, and violence: It all comes down to war, which doesn’t change.
- Hashes vs Hashtags: 1980s national security counsel fighting Al Quaeda. He was the moron talking about hashtags, not hashes, to counter Al Quaeda online presence.
    - How to interact with technologists and national security professionals: the nature of war doesn’t change. The character can change. He stresses that the fundamental nature of war doesn’t change.
    - No matter what we do in tech, we’re gonna have some 17 year old kid using it the field.
    - SNS: is that true, with AI things might be different?
    - Claus Witz: On War. Recommended reading

Anticipatory Intelligence: Rhombus Power and predicting the Russian/Ukraine war. 

- Dr. Anshuman Roy: commercial work published in 2023 was able to predict the war. Countries apparently act predictable. You acceleration of pattern recognition can happen with machines, and since the nature of war doesn’t change (every country does military exercises), we can make predictions.
    - We’re not psychoanalyzing Putin’s mind. We’re looking at truths within the imports, exports of the countries and logistics for immigrations with neighboring countries.
- Organizational, human limitations are gatekeepers for information flow. He claims that it’s a relic of the industrial age.
- How to incorporate these new tools (without sounding bad about our own national security)
    - Chris Lessons Learned: you can have perfect intelligence, there’s still a political context. He’s supposed to be bipartisan about national security.
    - Field officers have tremendous common sense. There can be great innovations from Washington, but they have to respect the kids in the field.
        - Give money to the people in the field. That’s the culture of innovation. Give them a chance, kick em out if they don’t succeed.
        - Chris is funny and brash af. So cool. Maybe it’s the military experience.

Hypotheticals: Competition with China, Russia, NK, Iran, adopting AI and other emerging technologies. 

- Another good book from Chris: Warbot AI (good systems with incorporate the ethos of the creators)
    - Winners win by innovating. Not necessarily going in with the best equipment.
- Roy: No way to know for sure. There is a certain level of **complacence** of how technologically advanced the US really is. There are people catching up quickly and are close.
    - Example: it’s so easy to find Adtech data in the US. Targeted ads is the same as targeting.
    - It just takes a small group of crazy people to do big things. Small group, meeting with serious people, then they became serious people doing big things.

Future Crisis in the Pacific or Middle East: What will AI look like in the situation room? 

- What should it look like: Intelligence analysis should be automated. Looking at Rhombus and other AI innovations, OSINT analysis.
    - Book: The Ranger Handbook.
- Trust is built through performance. In peacetime, we need to change the structure before there’s pressure on board. It’s happening already across enterprise, which is like a sandbox.
- Honesty about the true capabilities of AI systems is also crucial.

Setting norms for the use of AI in warfare. 

- The sound of freedom! It’s not 155mm rounds, it’s the drones flying round the exhibition.
- It’s from the leaders. Not just our policymakers, but the **YOUNG leaders.**
    - From the bottom up.
- Roy: we need to be careful about who we select to build the capabilities and how we are able to endow our creations with our values.
- Last book: the art of war.
