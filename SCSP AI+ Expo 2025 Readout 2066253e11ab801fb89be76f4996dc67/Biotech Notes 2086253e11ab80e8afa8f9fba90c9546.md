# Biotech Notes

- NSCEB: advisory board for congress on emerging technology.
- Biotechnology is important. Must act now instead of 3 years from now, as the field converges with AI.

Demo: Stefan Herrera with Cambrium 

- Bio for development of defense tech that is adaptable. Biotech on the battlefield.
- Lasers = directed energy = new bullets
    - Ukraine and S. China Sea
- Laser eye protection: current tech provides color acuity or protection. Their product dows both.
- Bio-enabled infusion? Protection from “being lazed”

Back to the Panel 

- How is AI enabling biotech?
    - “The biggest benefits to humanity will be AI applied to biology” because it touches so many things, including medical and military.
        - The entire biosphere really.
    - Current biotech is slow and fails often. AI can help researchers make senes of biology.
        - LLMS trained on DNA. Discovery → Design
    - NSCEB was formed to be ahead of the curve, so that it happens in America and happens quickly.
    - AI represents the first time we can integrate “all the information we have”.
- The bad of AI? AI for biodefense.
    - CBRN (chemical, bio, radio/electric, nuclear). Usually we’ve focused on the last 2, with bio being the least attended to. Chemical, biological have been forbidden **by those who signed agreements**, but not everyone is signed up or following through.
    - AI is allowing a proliferation of opportunity for harm. LLMs can be hacked to let you get info. As a democratizing force, it can be used in either direction.
- Use Cases:
    - Production: brewing beer or creating new chemicals, materials, etc. Critical for our supply chain to be robust and under our control. Might allow the midwest to be the hub for biotech, due to the sugar and crop production.
    - Unique Uses: biology creating novel materials and performances that cannot be replicated by traditional technology. Ex: the demo from earlier.
        - Bio can arrange atoms with atomic precision in every cell, reliably. We can’t do that in a lab or a factory.
        - Bio is good right now, but we’d love to modify these things.
- Examples at DARPA: It’s science fiction before science fact
    - Synthetic blood: civilian blood supply is temporal and is never enough. It is fragile and hard to carry. DARPA is at the third iteration, finally able to scale (kinda). It doesn’t do everything that blood does, but does the job at least temporarily. Shelf stable, temperature resistant. Looks like space food.
        - AI should help accelerate innovation and scaling.
    - H5N1: How to simulate biological evolution so we can predict whether or not a virus will be problematic. Simulate what could happen, ahead of time.
        - SNS: the DARPA guy speaks fast and clearly. He’s funny too.
    - Fungal Tiles: tiles on loose terrain that will provide quick tactical platforms for front-line use. Concrete sets in days, fungus sets in hours.
    - Critical minerals: we have an insane amount of critical minerals in electronics, but we can’t easily extract them. PRC is the best at this in the world. Biology has high selectivity, and could help in this field.
- MONEY: should bio be considered in the same bucket of investment as other tech?
    - Currently, the understanding of the public is not where it should be, so it is not as appreciated. More bio-literate seniors across congress, dod, etc.
    - Bio is actually one of the 14 prioritized technologies (like 5g, self driving).
    - Again, work in the federal side or on the defense side SHOULD have benefits in the private sector, build some product for the civilian side. That way it’s not just up to Uncle Sam to front the bill.
    - We should provide value and impact to earn the money instead of being like “just give us the money”. DARPA is aiming not to just push bounds a little, but seriously push the frontier forward.
- SCSP was partially created by the NSCAI, now it’s huge. The same thing could happen with bio.
- Going forward, what needs to happen? 15 billion dollars. Regulatory streamlining so that the private sector can come to play. Therapeutics are well established, but other fields don’t have the same investment class. Scale up pre-commercial, industrial infrastructure to support everyone.

    - the funding ecosystem is currently slightly mismatched.

- DARPA is pre-vc research. Impossible → kinda possible.
