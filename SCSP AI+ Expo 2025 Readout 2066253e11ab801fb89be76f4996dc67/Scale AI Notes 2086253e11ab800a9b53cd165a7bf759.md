# Scale AI Notes

- AI as a war
    - Alex was a student of the Manhattan project, parents both physicists in national labs. The power of tech to influence wars.
    - CCP has a battle plan to become dominant in AI for decades.
    - AI is (one of) the technology that will shape who is economically and militarily dominant in the future.
- AI as the future of deterrence
    - For nukes, everyone can see when you’re testing and launching.
    - For AI, people just use it in the economy. There’s no commercial nuclear bombs. There’s no “second strike” capabilities with AI like with nuclear. A sufficient cyber attack might disrupt nuclear capabilites
- AI compeitition with China
    - Neck and neck. Deepseek is an example, which was a shift from previous eras.
    - Computational power, data, algorithms are the three metrics.
        - Comp Power: US ahead.
        - Data: China ahead.
        - Algorithms: Not clear right now.
- Data Dominance: How is Scale AI helping out?
    - Ex: military data
    - We need a national AI data reserve
    - National Security Data is a priority since it is silo’d.
- Chip making: US needs to be at the forefront in all three aspects.
- US needs an AI master plan, Trump administration is currently working on something.
