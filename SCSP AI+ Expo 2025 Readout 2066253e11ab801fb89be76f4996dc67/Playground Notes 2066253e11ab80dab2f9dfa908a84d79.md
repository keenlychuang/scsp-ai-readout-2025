# Playground Notes

- Quantum centers with 1 million qubit capacity are being built in Queensland and Chicago
- Phasecraft is a startup focusing on quantum algorithms, which are innovating faster than the hardware side.
    - Ex: Density Functional Theory
- May 2025 Paper: Google Quantum, less than a million qubits for breaking 2048 RSA encryption. The pace and trajectory of research are exceeding expectations. The Chicago plant could run this algorithm, and it will be completed around the time the decade is out.
    - The Queensland one is going to finish in 2028.
- Another application: UV light production for ASML semiconductor production. The limiting factor for advanced semiconductors is UV light to create crystals. Quantum materials are producing millions or billions of dollars worth of efficiencies.
- NextSilicon: software automatically designing hardware implementations based on software, allowing for algorithm specific hardware that are orders more efficient than generic hardware.
- Non transistors, non semiconductor processing units. Superconducting logic
    - Being built in national labs, about to be adopted in commercial.
- Artificial photosynthesis.
- Really broad overview. Overall message: we are not stuck. We’re basically back at the start of the 18th century with scientific advances in electricity. It’s not animal magic that moves frog legs. It starts as an accident, then a battery, then an infinity of new discoveries.
