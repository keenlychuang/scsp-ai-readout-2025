# IQT Notes

- IQT has been investing for decades in the US, but is focusing on advancing the speed at which new technologies are being adopted in the national security sector. Working with the current administration.
    - Also working on frontier tech like quantum.
- Investing in supply chain, like critical minerals, to catch up to China with their independence.
- Investing in the traditional metrics: Team, Technology, Market
    - IQT says they are focused less on return and more about getting tech in the hands of government.
    - Not necessarily if theyâ€™ll be a big winner (profits), but if they have a viable model to be a long-term supporter of the USG.
- Keyword is trust. IQT is 25 years old and built the trust with other VC companies and entrepreneurs and government.
- A close second is understanding the customer. Know the priorities of the government (delivering solutions for mission) and translate between tech companies and gov.
- How is IQT vetting partners and companies?
    - Security review of the company by the company itself, security review with the government, then a second layer review. Who does the company being reviewed work with? Are they trustworthy?
