# SCSP AI+ Expo 2025 Readout

## About the Expo

- The Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP) is a non-partisan think tank focused on technology in national security, and was formed to continue the work of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) in 2021. It was founded by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, and the current president and CEO is Ylli Bajraktari, the former director of the NSCAI. The ai+ expo took place from June 2nd to June 4th at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center.  It hosted partners from the US Government and industry, from the military to national labs to frontier AI companies to startups focusing on niche topics and applications.
- I attended the expo during a week of training that allowed me to spend time in the city, and I took notes on major keynote speeches and demos during days 1 and 3. My goal, as a new agency data engineer, was to see what technologies were being promoted as state of the art, where professionals and policymakers thought AI could have the most impact on. Many of the talks were recorded and are posted on the [SCSP Youtube Page](https://www.youtube.com/@SCSPAI/videos).

## Conferences vs Expos

- This was my first time going to an expo as opposed to a conference, but I was still surprised at how product-first and accessible it was.  The event was open to the public and free to attend, and during the first day, the line took nearly an hour to get through. The venue itself had three main stages, two stages for the press, and a few stages sponsored by major companies like Rhombus and Palantir. Essentially all of the events on the main stages felt readily accessible and outward facing, but the breakout sessions in the smaller rooms were much more technically dense.

## Takeaways for a Data Scientist, Data Engineer

- There is a major emphasis on bringing in **private sector technologies into the public sphere** for their efficiencies and innovation ([DOD](SCSP%20AI+%20Expo%202025%20Readout%202066253e11ab801fb89be76f4996dc67/Army%20of%20the%20Future%202066253e11ab8034b7f5f08400bd6d07.md), [National Labs](SCSP%20AI+%20Expo%202025%20Readout%202066253e11ab801fb89be76f4996dc67/Focus%20of%20National%20Laboratories%202066253e11ab803e8fb6c78a61026577.md), [Former Secretary of Defense](SCSP%20AI+%20Expo%202025%20Readout%202066253e11ab801fb89be76f4996dc67/Keynote%20Future%20of%20National%20Security%202066253e11ab803fa6f4d8895d989a83.md)). For example, there are ongoing partnerships with large, frontier AI companies ([OpenAI](SCSP%20AI+%20Expo%202025%20Readout%202066253e11ab801fb89be76f4996dc67/OpenAI%20Notes%202066253e11ab80639148efe97626bb8f.md), [Anthropic](SCSP%20AI+%20Expo%202025%20Readout%202066253e11ab801fb89be76f4996dc67/Anthropic%20Product%20Demo%202066253e11ab8042abb4ff82125ba5a5.md)) as well as smaller startups (Applied Intuition). The USG will get early access to certain technologies through ([National Labs](SCSP%20AI+%20Expo%202025%20Readout%202066253e11ab801fb89be76f4996dc67/Focus%20of%20National%20Laboratories%202066253e11ab803e8fb6c78a61026577.md)) and agencies, similar to evaluative startups. Government is not looking to compete with private, but act as a guiding hand and investor ([IQT](SCSP%20AI+%20Expo%202025%20Readout%202066253e11ab801fb89be76f4996dc67/IQT%20Notes%202086253e11ab80b6910add00009b1960.md)).
- **AI adoption speed and data availability** are major obstacles for the adoption of AI by the USG([OpenAI](SCSP%20AI+%20Expo%202025%20Readout%202066253e11ab801fb89be76f4996dc67/OpenAI%20Notes%202066253e11ab80639148efe97626bb8f.md), Scale). We can innovate on algorithms and compute, but fall behind in data because inherently have more respect for our citizen‚Äôs privacy than PRC. At the moment, AI adoption is more trusted in the east ([OpenAI](SCSP%20AI+%20Expo%202025%20Readout%202066253e11ab801fb89be76f4996dc67/OpenAI%20Notes%202066253e11ab80639148efe97626bb8f.md)). Building out fundamentally secure and private software, but especially hardware, will slow down innovation. However, implementing these access controls and cyber concerns early will be required to ensure regulations do not become surveillance concerns ([ManTech](SCSP%20AI+%20Expo%202025%20Readout%202066253e11ab801fb89be76f4996dc67/ManTech%20Notes%202066253e11ab80ada9acc83faa97e08e.md), [NVIDIA](SCSP%20AI+%20Expo%202025%20Readout%202066253e11ab801fb89be76f4996dc67/NVIDIA%20Notes%202066253e11ab80e3a00ff2c99eb2a9b1.md))
- **Tighter academic restrictions are a major hurdle for innovation**. The proposed endowment tax and reduced national funding for science in areas like the NIH and NSF are particularly harmful for large universities. While the the public doesn‚Äôt always relate to universities with huge endowments, but their research is uniquely positioned to help the US people. Academic research is aimed at work that has long-term benefits without immediate profit, distinguishing it from private research. They are also decades old institutions entrenched in the talent business, attracting researchers across the globe to promote soft power. The threat to universities affects federal programs like DARPA and IARPA, and countries like the UK and France are offering incentives for scientists to come to their countries instead ([MIT](SCSP%20AI+%20Expo%202025%20Readout%202066253e11ab801fb89be76f4996dc67/MIT%20Notes%202066253e11ab80a98991d35362277fee.md)).
- AI has **downstream applications in core technologies** like nuclear fission/fusion or biotech, driving even more funding ([National Labs](SCSP%20AI+%20Expo%202025%20Readout%202066253e11ab801fb89be76f4996dc67/Focus%20of%20National%20Laboratories%202066253e11ab803e8fb6c78a61026577.md), [Biotech](SCSP%20AI+%20Expo%202025%20Readout%202066253e11ab801fb89be76f4996dc67/Biotech%20Notes%202086253e11ab80e8afa8f9fba90c9546.md)). Federally funded core technologies have the potential to benefit the public in unexpected ways, like with the invention of GPS that came out of Cold War research.
- While AI is new, the problem of security control, vetting, and trust in high-stakes environments is not new ([National Labs](SCSP%20AI+%20Expo%202025%20Readout%202066253e11ab801fb89be76f4996dc67/Focus%20of%20National%20Laboratories%202066253e11ab803e8fb6c78a61026577.md)). The USG has prioritized safety for decades, and it has a rigorous process for vetting people working on sensitive information. The problem of war doesn‚Äôt change either, just the tools used for it (Former Secretary of Defense). At the end of the day, the USG has to prepare early for high-stakes situations and innovate with agility if or when conflict breaks out.
- **International cooperation can benefit all countries involved**. Asia-pacific countries have specialties in education, policy, culture, and infrastructure that simply do not exist in the US ([Asia Tech Playbook](SCSP%20AI+%20Expo%202025%20Readout%202066253e11ab801fb89be76f4996dc67/Asia%20Tech%20Playbook%202066253e11ab80879a59da348ee3b16f.md), Delivering Peace in the Indo-Pacific, [Joint Chief of Staff DOD](SCSP%20AI+%20Expo%202025%20Readout%202066253e11ab801fb89be76f4996dc67/Military%20Notes%202086253e11ab806bbec4e361946d89df.md)). The exception seems to be China, as the DOD recommends countries might take a ‚Äúhippocratic oath‚Äù not to support a country that perpetrates genocides. They say they are friendly, but their actions tell the real story (Indo-Pacific).
- There was a surprising **lack of political divisiveness**. It seems that both parties can agree on investment in tech and in national security. Multiple times, there were calls for a bi-partisan talks of a unified ‚ÄúAI master plan‚Äù to compete with China‚Äôs 5 year plans ([Scale](SCSP%20AI+%20Expo%202025%20Readout%202066253e11ab801fb89be76f4996dc67/Scale%20AI%20Notes%202086253e11ab800a9b53cd165a7bf759.md), Hong Kong).

## Conclusions

- The expo revealed a striking bipartisan consensus around a new technological statecraft that leverages public-private integration to develop America's AI competitive edge. Rather than attempting to outpace private innovation, the government is positioning itself as a strategic partner and early adopter, creating pathways for frontier technologies to transition into national security applications while maintaining rigorous safety standards. This approach represents a calculated embrace of America's core strengths‚Äîsuperior compute infrastructure, established safety protocols, and institutional trustworthiness‚Äîover raw speed of deployment. While authoritarian competitors may achieve faster adoption through weaker privacy protections, the U.S. is betting that its methodical approach to building secure, privacy-respecting AI systems will prove more sustainable and globally influential in the long term.

# June 2nd: Day 1

**Overall**

- Podcast format on the main stage. Doesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs time for questions, very softball. They should release the recordings, it seems like the perfect format for that. Or an actual, literal podcast.
- Very product facing for many talks. Very non-technical for the most part.
- Breakout rooms are much more focused, less fluffy. Mantech was more specific, more catered. NVIDIA had very detailed policy talks. Detailed infrastructure recommendations and QA with leading academics or professionals
- **Misc Notes**
    - A major line getting in. Plan to get here an hour early
    - People flying in for this. British guy building drones in Ukraine flew in for this. Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese companies have representation. EU delegations, Ukraine ambassadors have a presence.
    - Free admission means that everyone shows up. Overheard from an impatient patron ‚Äúyou should make sure that everyone has a credential.‚Äù
    - Make sure to bring a notebook and a phone bank in case you don‚Äôt have seats.
    - Make sure to schedule primary and secondary events. Rooms tend to fill up.

### üèùÔ∏è¬†Delivering Peace and Security in the Indo Pacific

9:00 ‚Üí 9:30, North Stage 

- Short Notes
    - Roy Rhombus: It‚Äôs not about just the models. It‚Äôs about the data. It‚Äôs not just intelligence databases, which are silo‚Äôd, but intelligent databases, which automate collection so that foundation and predictive models can do their work.
    - Gilberto Teodoro, Jr. (Secretary of the National Defense of the Phillipines): China has a deficit of trust. Intellectual property, individual sovereignty, user confidence. There is no match in the China vs the west. They say they are brotherly, but everyone is aware of their global ambitions to change the world order. Their actions, especially in the Indo-Pacific, speak for themselves.
